        | We have published the frequencies aggregated by disease and sex for the dataset JGAD000123 in June 2024.
        | In some cases, multiple disease names were assigned to the same sample. Please see the publication below for details about the samples.
        | By using the “Alternative allele frequency/count” in the Advanced search, you can search for variants based on the frequencies aggregated by disease and sex.
