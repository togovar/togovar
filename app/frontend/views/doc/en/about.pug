            | TogoVar (A comprehensive Japanese genetic variation database) is a database that has collected
            | and organized genome sequence differences between individuals (variants) in the Japanese population and
            | disease information associated with them.
          p.body
            | TogoVar provides variant frequencies in the Japanese population that have been aggregated across research
            | projects. Two available datasets,

            a(href='/doc/datasets/jga_ngs') JGA-NGS
            |  and
            |
            a(href='/doc/datasets/jga_snp') JGA-SNP
            | , are obtained by aggregating individual genomic data that have been registered in

            a(href='/doc/datasets') information related to genotypes or phenotypes
            |  that has been compiled independently in a variety of different databases and provides information for
